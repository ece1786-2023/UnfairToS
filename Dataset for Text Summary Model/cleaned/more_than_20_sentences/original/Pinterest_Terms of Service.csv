Dollars (u.s.

11.
Arbitration
"For any dispute you have with pinterest, you agree to first contact us and try to resolve the dispute with us informally."
"If we need to contact you, we will do so at the email address on your pinterest account."
"If pinterest hasn t been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these terms through binding arbitration or (for qualifying claims) in small claims court."
Arbitration is a more informal way to resolve our disagreements than a lawsuit in court.
"For instance, arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, involves more limited discovery, and is subject to very limited review by courts."
"Although the process is more informal, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award."
"You agree that, by agreeing to these terms of service, the u.s."
"Federal arbitration act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and pinterest are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action."
"The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement."
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this agreement and the termination of your pinterest account.
"Any arbitration will be administered by the american arbitration association (""aaa"") under the consumer arbitration rules then in effect for the aaa, except as provided herein."
You can find their forms at www.adr.org.
"Unless you and pinterest agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county (or parish) where you reside."
"Each party will be responsible for paying any aaa filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with aaa rules, except that pinterest will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in federal rule of civil procedure 11(b))."
"If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the aaa rules."
"If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the aaa rules."
"Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction."
"Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts, including for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the service."
"All claims must be brought in the parties' individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims."
"You agree that,"
"By entering into these terms, you and pinterest are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action."
Nothing in these terms of service shall affect any non-waivable statutory rights that apply to you.
"To the extent any claim, dispute or controversy regarding pinterest or our service isn t arbitrable under applicable laws or otherwise: you and pinterest both agree that any claim or dispute regarding pinterest will be resolved exclusively in accordance with section 12 of these terms."
"If you're a consumer in the eea, section 11 doesn't apply to you"
12.
Governing law and jurisdiction
"These terms shall be governed by the laws of the state of california, without respect to its conflict of laws principles."
"If you are not a consumer in the eea, the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with this agreement is san francisco county, california, or the united states district court for the northern district of california and our dispute will be determined under california law."
"If you are a consumer in the eea, this won t deprive you of any protection you have under the law of the country where you live and access to the courts in that country"

"It doesn't matter what time of year it is, that's what's so great!"
"Anyway, you'll have to sue us here"
