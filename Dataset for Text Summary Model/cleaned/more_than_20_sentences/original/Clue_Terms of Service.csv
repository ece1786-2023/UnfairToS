"Notwithstanding the requirement for a valid consent to processing your personal data under our privacy policy, you must be at least 13 years old ( minimum age ) to use clue's paid services (see 6 below)."
"If a minor between the ages of 13 and 17 (a person reaches majority at 18 under german law) uses clue's paid services, we provide the services on the basis of the deemed consent of their parent or legal guardian, both to these terms and to the use of the clue app."

We will always ask for your consent to material changes to these terms if they affect any paid services (see 6).

"However, this does not prevent us from improving our services or including additional features or services within the scope of paid services."
2.3.

"4 general scope of services of clue, clue plus and other clue premium features"
4.1.
Clue is designed to provide general information about menstrual and reproductive health and related topics.
"The app collects the data you enter, for example on menstrual cycles, physical activities, health and medications, pregnancy, and other data about the body."
These data allow statistical and algorithmic data processing that can show you patterns in your menstrual cycle or pregnancy.
4.2.
Clue is a self-management app.
"This means that clue's services are based on the data that you provide, so the information and analysis available in the app depends on the amount and accuracy of the inputs you choose to record."
4.3.
Clue is intended for use on ios and android mobile devices in the following app versions:
"(a) usage with an account (requiring registration): in this case, the data is stored both locally on your mobile phone and on our servers, so that the service can be used on multiple logged-in devices ( clue as an online service )."
Further details regarding the registration process can be found in 5 of these terms.
"(b) usage without creating an account (without registration): in this case, the data is only stored locally on the memory of your mobile phone ( clue as a local service ) - this service is no longer available to new users."
4.4.
"Clue offers some functions and content free of charge ( "" clue"", or the ""basic"" clue app), while access to more extensive functions and content is paid (the ""paid services"", see 6 below)."
"The basic clue app can be acquired free of charge from the relevant app store (if you have an iphone, the apple app store, or if you have an android phone, the google play store)."
"In addition, you can purchase the paid services, clue plus and other clue premium features, from within the basic clue app."
4.5.
"In order to help us continue to provide the clue services, we reserve the right to display advertisements on our website or in our app."
"We may also offer the opportunity to donate via the website or app, so that you can support our services and mission."
5 creating a clue account
5.1.
"Today, clue exists only as an online service."
"To use clue, you need to create an account."
"This requires an acceptance of these terms and consent to data processing under the terms of our privacy policy, including all documents, declarations and consents included therein by reference."
"Furthermore, you will need to provide a username, email address, and a personalized password."
"In addition, you can provide other information as part of your onboarding, in order to personalize your clue experience from the start."
"Account creation is completed when you click on the link in the confirmation email sent to your email address, confirming your account."
5.2.
"Alternatively, you can create an account using your apple, google or facebook login details, which automatically transfers your relevant personal information."
5.3.
"When you create an account, you assure that all of the information you provide is correct and complete."

6.2.
You can find an overview of the benefits included in a clue plus subscription on our website at https://helloclue.com/articles/about-clue/introducing-clue-plus.

The paid services are generally available on a subscription basis.
"Therefore, you will be charged once in the duration period of your subscription (for instance per month or per year)."

"The descriptions of our different services - whether the basic free clue app, clue plus, or other clue premium services - are not subject to any guarantees."
"We give no guarantee that any of our services can be used to achieve a specific aim, such as that events in your individual menstrual cycle will be correctly predicted, or that clue's outputs are complete and accurate."
9.3.
"We expressly point out that any health-related recommendations provided in the context of the clue services are general in nature, and aimed at users who are generally healthy and physically and mentally fit."
"We give references to published research and other sources wherever possible, so that you can find out more and evaluate the information for yourself."
"If you choose to follow any such general recommendations, you do so at your own risk."
"If you have any doubt as to whether this is appropriate for you, please speak to your qualified healthcare provider."
This applies especially if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
9.4.
Any liability in respect of contractual or other claims made by you as a user depends on the merits of the case and extends only to actual damage suffered
"(a) which we, our legal representatives or vicarious agents have caused intentionally or by gross negligence,"
"(b) from injury to life, body or health resulting from a breach of duty by us or one of our legal representatives or vicarious agents,"
"(c) in cases of liability under the german product liability act, due to us having given a guarantee or due to fraudulent misrepresentation, and"
"(d) which has arisen due to the breach of a fundamental obligation, the fulfillment of which is of fundamental importance to the proper execution of the contract, and which you are entitled to rely on and in fact regularly rely on (under german law, a cardinal obligation)."
9.5.
"We are liable without limitation in the above-mentioned cases (a), (b) and (c) of the preceding paragraph."

"And notwithstanding the following paragraph, liability on our part is excluded irrespective of the legal grounds."

"If you are using clue without an account, you can terminate this contract by deleting the clue app from your mobile phone (remember to export your data first if you don't want to lose it)."
"We too may terminate the contract at our sole discretion and without further notice, subject to the following provisions."
10.2.
The paid services run for the agreed (initial) term.
"At the end of the term, the contract is automatically extended by a time period equal to the agreed term, but by no more than one year, unless you or we terminate it before the end of the agreed term."

"For technical and legal reasons, contractual relationships related to the use of paid services that were originally entered into via the apple app store or the google play store can only be terminated via the respective app stores."
"In such cases, apple and google act as resellers of the services."

"According to google and apple, notice of termination must be provided no later than 24 hours before the renewal of the subscription."
10.4.
The statutory right of both contracting parties to terminate the contract for good cause remains unaffected.
"Good cause for extraordinary termination of the contract is deemed to exist if the continuation of the contractual relationship until the end of the normal period of notice is unreasonable, given all circumstances of the individual case and the interests of the user."
"Good causes for us to exercise this right of termination include, in particular, if you breach applicable law, obligations under these terms, or obligations under your contract with the apple app store or google play store (or if your actions would cause us to breach our contracts with the apple app store or google play store)."
No prior notice of termination is required.
11 other provisions
11.1.
"We endeavor to ensure that the clue app operates without disruption and is available to the greatest extent possible, but we point out that complete and uninterrupted availability is not technically feasible."

The above provisions shall also apply in the event that the provisions prove to be incomplete.
11.8.
"Clue is used by people with cycles around the world, who access the app in a multitude of different languages."

"However, please understand that we cannot assure 100% accuracy for all of our translations, in particular with respect to any legal content."

12 how to exercise your right of revocation
