Introduction
Thank you for using openstreetmap.
These terms cover your use of services officially operated and provided by the openstreetmap foundation (osmf).
In particular these are:
"The openstreetmap.org website and associated services and apis,"
"The openstreetmap data distribution,"
"The openstreetmap wiki and help websites,"
The openstreetmap mailing lists and forums.
"(together, the services )."
"By using these services, you agree to be bound by the following terms of service, as updated from time to time (collectively, the ""terms""')."
Please read them carefully.
"If you don t agree to these terms, you may not use the services."
Please be aware of the following:
Osmf as host: openstreetmap is a collaborative project.
"A volunteer group operates the infrastructure and websites (many of which are collaborative open source projects), but the map data, wiki, mailing lists, and forums are contributed by users."
"While one of the goals of the openstreetmap project is an accurate open data map of the world, openstreetmap foundation does not and cannot proactively review all edits or other contributions."
"Therefore, we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any submitted community content."
Suspected data problems may be reported to the data working group in accordance with its procedures.
"You are responsible for your own actions: you are legally responsible for your edits and contributions,"
So for your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid contributing any content that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws.
"Although we may not agree with such actions, we warn editors and contributors that authorities may seek to apply other countries laws to you, including local laws where you live or where you view or edit content."
"Osmf generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or indemnification."
Openstreetmap ( osm ) data available through these services is licensed under the open database license as interpreted by the osmf guidelines.
Contributions to osm are governed by the osm contributor terms.
"Though we hope osm and its supporting projects will continue for the foreseeable future,"
"We reserve the right to suspend or end the services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice."
Ii.
Privacy
"We ask that you review the terms of our privacy policy, so that you are aware of how we collect and use your information."
Certain aspects of the services require you to have an osm account and to be logged into that account while you access those aspects.
"Because our services are used by people all over the world, personal information that we collect may be stored and processed in any other country in which we or our agents maintain facilities."
"If you are a resident of the eu, eea, or efta, your information will be stored and processed in accordance with the gdpr."
"If you are a resident of another country, you consent to any such transfer of information outside your country by using our services."
You agree to keep the contact information associated with your osm account current and complete.
Your contact information will be used in accordance with the privacy policy.
Use by minors
You must be 13 years or older to use the services.
"If you are at least 13 but under 16 years of age, a parent or other adult authorized by your parent may create an account for you to use."
"The account must not contain any personal data about you, and you must not add any personal data about yourself."
"For example, your parent may create an account using your parent s email address and a username that is not associated with you, which your parent may permit you to use to contribute map edits."
"For your protection, you are not allowed to use the social aspects of the services (diary posts, home location, mailing lists and forums), but you may contribute edits to the map."
You should not reveal any personal data in any communications you have regarding your map edits.
"By registering as a user or providing personal information on the services, you represent that you are at least 16 years old."
