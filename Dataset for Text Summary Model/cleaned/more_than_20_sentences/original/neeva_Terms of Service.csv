"As stated in the introduction, under section 17 you and neeva are agreeing to submit any dispute to an arbitrator under the rules of the american arbitration association."
The exceptions to that rule are claims that can be heard in small claims court and claims asking for an injunction.
"Note that if you win in arbitration, we may be required to pay your legal fees, but if we win, you don t have to pay ours (unless the arbitrator believes your claim was frivolous)."
You and neeva are also each waiving the right to assert a class action.
"As always, we encourage you to reach out to us directly."
We want you to have a great experience!
17.
Dispute resolution.
(a)
Mandatory arbitration of disputes.
"We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the services (collectively, disputes ) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding."
You and neeva agree that the u.s.
"Federal arbitration act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these terms, and that you and neeva are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action."
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these terms.
(b) exceptions.
As limited exceptions to section 17(a) above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a dispute in small claims court if it qualifies.
And (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.
(c)
Conducting arbitration and arbitration rules.
"The arbitration will be conducted by the american arbitration association ( aaa ) under its consumer arbitration rules (the aaa rules ) then in effect, except as modified by these terms."
The aaa rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written demand for arbitration to aaa and give notice to the other party as specified in the aaa rules.
The aaa provides a form demand for arbitration at www.adr.org.
Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live unless we both agree to a different location.
"The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, and scope of this arbitration agreement."
(d)
Arbitration costs
"Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the aaa rules, and we won t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your dispute frivolous."
"If we prevail in arbitration, we ll pay all of our attorneys fees and costs and won t seek to recover them from you."
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.
(e)
Injunctive and declaratory relief.
"Except as provided in section 17(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party s individual claim."
"To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration."
The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.
(f)
Class action waiver.
"You and neeva agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding."
"Further, if the parties dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person s claims with your claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding."
"If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this dispute resolution section shall be null and void."
(g)
Severability.
"With the exception of any of the provisions in section 17(f) of these terms ( class action waiver ), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these terms will still apply."
Section 18 is a miscellaneous collection of terms.
Section 18(a) states that we (and our licensors) own all rights in the services and you won t remove or change any notices of those rights.
Section 18(b) states that these terms are the entire agreement between us and that you cannot transfer these terms to someone else.
Section 18(c) informs you how we ll provide you with notices.
"Section 18(d) explains that if we choose not to enforce these terms in a certain case, we may still enforce them in other cases."
18.

"You may not assign or transfer these terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without neeva s prior written consent."
"Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these terms, without such consent, will be null."
Neeva may freely assign or transfer these terms without restriction.
"Subject to the foregoing, these terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns."
(c)
Notices.
Any notices or other communications provided by neeva under these terms will be given: (i) via email.
Or (ii) by posting to the services.
"For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted."
(d)
Waiver of rights.
Neeva s failure to enforce any right or provision of these terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision.
The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of neeva.
"Except as expressly set forth in these terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these terms or otherwise."
