Who can open a curve account?
You can open a curve account:
"If you re a resident in one of the eligible countries listed in the app or on our website,"
"Have the full legal capacity to enter into a contract, and"
You re 18 years old or over.
You can t open a curve account:
"On someone else s behalf, or"
"If you already have a curve account, or"
If there is any reason that curve is unable to grant you an account under the law that applies to us.
"When you open your account, we ask you for information which is required to open the account"
"If this information is not provided, your account opening will be delayed"
"We may ask you for additional information, from time to time, in addition to what you provided when you opened your account and if this information is not provided to meet our requirements this may result in your account being suspended or closed."
What should you know about your curve account?
E-money.
"Your curve account stores e-money, an electronic alternative to cash that can be used to pay for goods and services, in store or online and to take money out at an atm."
Rest assured that your money is always kept separate from our own.
This is known as customer funds safeguarding.
It is required by law and ensures that your money is protected and returned to you in full if we decide to cease operations or become insolvent.
No interest.
We re not allowed to pay you interest on the funds we hold for you and they are not protected by the deposit insurance fund.
"Don t worry: curve is required to keep your funds safe in a safeguarding bank account, which means that all of your funds are protected."
How it works.
"You need to link and verify an eligible payment card to your curve account in the curve app, before you can use your curve card."
"The payment card can be any debit card, credit card or prepaid card that we allow you to link to your curve account."
"We may need to introduce certain restrictions on the cards that we are able to accept on to the curve system and will try to keep you informed on any changes, some of which may depend on the card schemes."
"When you make a transaction using your curve card, curve (with your permission) loads funds from your selected payment card to curve."
This is done for you automatically by the curve processing system (no hassle to you).
"The amount loaded will be the value of the transaction, plus any fees for that transaction (including for any curve services provided)."
The loaded funds are used to issue e-money which is loaded onto your curve e-money account and are then used to pay for the transaction made with your curve card.
"If your selected payment card account has insufficient funds or declines the transaction for any other reason, the transaction will be declined."
"In case curve receives a decline from the payment card selected in the curve app, we may try to process the transaction from the cards that you have set as your default or back up cards (for more information on how to set this up, go here)"
You can add multiple payment cards to the curve app and change the selected payment card at any time using the curve app.
Each time you link a payment card to your curve account you re giving us a continuous authority to use that payment card to fund the purchase of the e-money used to pay for transactions.
Curve will use various means to identify that the card you have added to your account is yours and that you have the right to use it.
You can see your transactions on the timeline in the curve app.
What should you know about your curve card?
"Curve will issue you either a personal or business curve card, based on the purpose of the card use you selected during the sign-up process."
It will either be a physical and/or digital card.
"A digital card is a card where you can see your curve card details in the curve app only, and can request a physical card if you want one (fees for this are in the fee schedule)."
"You can use your curve card to make purchases for goods and services, in store or online."
"To withdraw cash, you will ."
Need a physical curve card.
Please note that you cannot withdraw cash at an atm if you have your curve cash card selected as a funding source for the curve card.

"Paying off a credit card with an underlying credit card selected), is defined by curve as a curve fronted transaction and will attract a service fee (see our fees schedule for details)."

Please remember that when you fund your curve card with a credit card or other card that applies fees to transactions:
Your underlying credit card issuer may also apply fees in relation to curve fronted transactions using curve.
Curve will not be liable for such fees.

"Provide your curve card details (card number, expiry date, cvv number),"
"Wave or swipe your curve card (digital or physical) over or near a contactless payment reader,"
"Use your curve card and pin to withdraw cash from a payment terminal, e.g at atm,"
Select a contact of yours and instruct the transfer of funds to that person in the curve app.
"When you use your curve card to make a withdrawal from an atm or make a payment (for example, in a shop or restaurant), we will consider the payment to be authorised by you unless:"
You let us know that the money has been stolen from your account.
Or
You don't think we've carried out your instructions correctly.
"We start to process your transaction at the time you use your card either for an atm withdrawal, online transaction or payment at a terminal."
It s important to note that the authorisation for a transaction lasts for 30 days and can be processed at any time during these 30 days.
"If a merchant processes your transaction after 30 days, you agree that we can still process the transaction."
You remain responsible under these terms in respect of all transactions you authorise on your curve account including all charges and other amounts incurred.
"You also agree that if curve is unable to collect the corresponding funds from your funding card at time these become due to be paid by curve to the merchant, curve is authorised to collect such funds from any of your other funding cards loaded into the curve app."
Cancelling transactions.
You can cancel a transaction you ve agreed to pay in the future up until close of business on the day before the transaction is due to take place.
Just contact us to do this.
Changes to payment amounts.
"Sometimes, you might make changes to a purchase between the time you authorise the transaction and the time the merchant processes it."
"In these cases, the merchant may amend the payment amount to reflect this change."
You agree that we may pay the additional amount to the merchant on the basis of your initial authorisation and charge the shortfall to .
You.
Pre-authorisations.
"If you ve used your card to pre-authorise a transaction of less than eur 150 (or its equivalent in your local currency), we may place a block on those funds (meaning you can t use them) or charge the amount to your payment card at the time you pre-authorise the transaction."
"If the final amount is less than eur 150, we ll refund or unblock the difference."
Continuous payment authority.
You can use your curve card to set up a future payment (either on a one-off or recurring basis) on a selected payment card.
"We ll make the payment from the payment card you ve selected in the curve app at the time we process the transaction, which may be a different payment card to the one you had selected at the time you set up the future payment."
"If you need to cancel such payments, get in touch with us."
Spending limits.
We have limits on how much you can spend or withdraw - these are set out in your curve app.
We may change these limits every now and then.
"You can ask us to increase your limits - if we refuse, you have to wait 3 months to request another review."
Reasons we may .
Refuse or delay a payment?
"Security: we re concerned about the security of your curve card or account,"
"Fraud: we suspect fraud on your account,"
"Law or regulation: we need to comply with the relevant law or regulation,"
"Your actions: the transaction breaches limits which apply to your curve account you ve breached these terms, you ve failed to provide us with information we ve asked for, or your account has been blocked for any other legitimate reason, or"
Third parties: if a third party (e.g.
A card network) prevents us from making the payment.
"If we are permitted to do so, we ll tell you if we refuse to make a payment and (where possible) why."
We may need to contact you urgently if we suspect or find fraudulent activity has occurred on your account (provided we are not prohibited from doing so by law) or if we suffer a security threat.
"When we contact you, we will also give you information on how you can minimise any risk to your payment instrument depending on the nature of the fraud or security threat."
We ll use the same contact details which you have already provided us with when contacting you.
So please make sure you keep your account details up to date by contacting us.
What about foreign currency transactions?
In case of withdrawals or purchases using your curve card where the currency of your selected payment card is different to the currency of the transaction - curve will perform a currency conversion for you.
"If, when making a transaction, you have set your payment ."
Card currency in the curve app to a different currency than that of the payment card itself then your payment card issuer may charge a fee for using their currency conversion services.
This might be in addition to any fees that curve charges you
If we have to convert the currency of a payment made using your curve card we ll use an exchange rate which will be either the:
Standard exchange rate.
"On a weekday we will normally use an exchange rate collected from our wholesale provider, though when the exchange rate is volatile we may use the rate as of midnight on that day."
"We ll use this rate during the hours foreign currency markets are open in london, uk."
We can let you know the rate for a transaction if you get in touch with us.
Weekend exchange rate.
"This is the rate at the time the markets are closed in london, u.k."
It will apply from the time the markets close until they open again.
We can let you know the rate for a transaction if you get in touch with us.
Please check our fee schedule to find out the currency conversion fee applicable for the currency exchange transactions.
"Exchange rates can fluctuate between the date you made the transaction and the date it s actually processed by the merchant to your account, please note that changes in the exchange rates will be applied immediately and without notice."
The rate applied to a transaction will be shown in the curve app
"If you use the go back in time feature in relation to a foreign currency transaction, it s possible that a different exchange rate to the one used for the original transaction will apply."
"If the merchant subsequently refunds the foreign transaction payment, the exchange rate used will be the one at the date the transaction was settled, not when the refund is settled."
You can contact us at support@curve.com for details of the exchange rate for any transaction.
You can also find the exchange rate that was applied to your transaction in your curve app.
We ll not be responsible to you if you re charged fees or lose any money if you ask the merchant or any other third party to make the currency conversion.
Who s responsible for losses on your curve card or account?
When you ll be responsible.
You re responsible for all losses where:
"You ve acted fraudulently,"
"You deliberately failed to keep your device, account details or your curve card and account security details safe."
"If you don t tell us as soon as you realise that your card is lost or stolen, when you think or suspect that someone else knows your security details, or there have been unauthorised transactions on your curve card, you ll have to pay up to eur 50 (or its equivalent in your home currency) of the losses."
When we ll be responsible
"We'll always try to process your payments correctly and on time, but sometimes things go wrong."
"If they do, we ll refund you any money you ve lost as a result of:"
"Any unauthorised transaction which you ve promptly reported (and within 13 months of the transaction), provided you ve not acted fraudulently or carelessly,"
"Our mistakes, or"
Transactions authorised by us after you locked your card (but only to the amount of the original authorisation).
We may also refund you where you ve used your curve card to make a payment in the european economic area (eea) without knowing the exact amount beforehand (e.g.
When hiring a car) and the final amount is much higher than you reasonably would have expected.
Just drop us a line through the app or at support@curve.com as soon as you notice it but not later than .
"13 months after the date of the transaction, and provide us with any further information we need to look into this."
We ll then make a decision either to refund the transaction or give you reasons for rejecting your request.
What can i not use my curve account and curve card for?
We know most customers will but you must use your curve account and card responsibly.
You can t use them:
For anything that s against the law (e.g.
"Fraud) or is harmful or disrespectful to others, including any form of abuse of us or our staff,"
"In breach of these terms,"
"In a way that might harm our ability to provide our services or may harm our software, systems or hardware,"
"In a way that your payment card issuer, a card network, our acquirer and/ or payment processor, would see as an abuse of the payments system,"
"To pay for adult entertainment, gambling, cryptocurrencies, money orders (except wire transfers) and travellers cheques from non-financial institutions,"
"For cash recycling , which means using your curve card to make an atm withdrawal and using the cash to repay the payment card used for the withdrawal in order to receive rewards on the payment card or your curve card,"
"To create one or more curve account(s) without our permission attempt to double dip or to do anything during the course of a dispute to receive funds from us and your bank or payment card issuer for the same transaction,"
To make transactions which are not allowed by the issuer of your linked payment card e.g.
Cash advances or transactions for investment purposes.
Check your payment card s terms to see what s allowed.
Money owed to curve
"In the event you owe curve money either for fees or transactions that you have made using curve, or missed subscription fees, we may immediately charge such amounts to any of your payment cards."
We reserve the right to collect the amount of your debt to curve by using any payments received to your account.
"We may also recover amounts you owe us through legal means, including, without limitation, through the use of a debt collection agency."
Curve features
Go back in time
This allows you to change the payment card you used to pay for certain transactions after they were made.
Check out which transactions this is possible for in the curve app (note that we can change this list and restrict customers from using this feature where we have a good reason to do so).
"Be aware your card issuer may charge a fee for this, which we re not responsible for."
Curve rewards
"From time to time, we offer our customers promotional offers with select retailers which you can choose to participate in if you wish."
We call this curve rewards.
Our curve rewards supplemental terms are here.
The terms specific to individual offers will be presented to you at the time you select the offer.
"Provided that you comply with the terms of the offers you choose to take part in, we will pay to your curve cash card an amount in accordance with those offers"
The funds paid by us to your curve cash card for any curve rewards offers will be held as e-money and safeguarded as required by lithuanian law.
These funds are available for you to spend when you select the curve cash card as a funding source for your curve card.
Please note that you cannot use your curve cash card to withdraw cash and it cannot be used by you to pay any fees to curve.
"If you want to withdraw funds from your curve cash card, you can get in touch with us."
Curve cash
Sometimes we offer our customers cashback in the form of points for using their curve account and card we call this curve cash.
You can check out the current curve cash terms .
On our website.
We change this every now and then but you can keep a tab on this through our website.
Curve cash is different to curve rewards.
"With curve cash, you ll receive curve cash points, which we add to your curve cash card."
"However, curve cash points have no cash value and are not deemed to be e-money or any other equivalent of a fiat currency (unlike curve rewards)."
Your curve cash points cannot be used to withdraw cash or otherwise be redeemed for cash.
You cannot use curve cash points to pay for any fees due to curve.
"When you use your curve cash card for a transaction, curve will convert your curve cash points to e-money (our little gift to you!)"
To the value of the transaction.
You will still be charged any fees that may be applicable to a transaction when these points are used.
"If there are not enough curve cash points on your curve cash card, the transaction will be declined."
"Please note that if your curve cash card holds curve cash points in addition to other funds (for example, from curve rewards) then those other funds will be used first and your curve cash points will only be converted to e-money and used when there are no other or insufficient other funds to complete a transaction."
Curve cash points expire 6 months from the date they are added to your curve cash card.
"If your account is closed either by you or by curve, you will not be able to redeem the value of your curve cash points."
Using the curve app to access accounts with other service providers
You can also access your accounts with other service providers and initiate payments from those accounts.
We call these account information service (ais) and payment initiation service (pis).
"When you use our ais to view information about an account you hold with another provider, or use our pis to initiate a payment from an account you hold with another provider to initiate a transaction, you must authorise us to access that account and/ or make a payment."
We won t store any of the sensitive payment data you provide to give that authorisation.
We will consider that you gave us consent and authorised us to initiate payments or view information from those accounts when you choose in your curve app the certain service and filled in requested information.
Open banking permissions
We may provide you access through the curve app to a third party ais and pis provider - to check whether this service is available in your country - please check here.
These services will allow you to obtain financial information from your online bank or third party payment account (account information services) and to make online payments directly from your third party payment account (payment initiation services).
You will need to sign up to the third party ais and pis provider s terms and conditions during the sign up process and provide them your details in order to create an account on their system and to access your data or execute payments.
"We have no responsibility for the products and services provided to you by or through the ais and pis third party provider and will not be liable to you for any harm, damage or loss arising from your use of the products and services provided to you by or through the third party ais and pis provider"
The terms and conditions that are connected to your third party payment account apply to the payment accounts that you access through the third party ais and pis provider will remain in effect and are not amended by these terms and conditions
