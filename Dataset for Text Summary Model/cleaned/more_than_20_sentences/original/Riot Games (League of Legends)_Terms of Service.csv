Part a: general dispute resolution (no matter where you live)
17.2.
"If we have a dispute, can we 1 v 1 instead?"
"(no, we should negotiate first."
)
Disputes can be expensive and time consuming for both parties (justice doesn t come on swift wings outside valoran).
"In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute or claim related to these terms ( claim ), you and riot games agree to first attempt to informally negotiate any claim for at least thirty (30) days (except as set out in section 17.4 below)."
17.3.

"To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law and without limiting your statutory rights to initiate a court proceeding, you and riot games agree that the following claims are not subject to the other provisions in this part a concerning negotiations: (i) any claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or riot games intellectual property rights."

17.5.
What the heck is arbitration?
(a private dispute resolution method.
No courtrooms or juries.
)
Arbitration is an alternative dispute resolution process in which the parties agree to have their disputes decided by a neutral third party and not by a sitting judge or jury.
Arbitration allows parties to resolve their disputes privately and without the formality of going to court.
"Arbitration follows different procedural rules than a court would, and is subject to very limited review by courts."
17.6.
Will arbitration allow for the same type of relief as a court?
(yes.
)
The arbitrator shall have the power to award any type of legal or equitable relief that would be available in a court of competent jurisdiction.
The arbitrator s decision (called an award ) will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim and provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
"The award will be final and binding upon the parties, may be confirmed by a court of competent jurisdiction, and then enforced like any other court order or judgment."
17.7.
What claims are we agreeing to submit to arbitration?
(almost everything.
)
"Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or related to these terms or the riot services shall be resolved exclusively by private, binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that qualifying small claims may be submitted in small claims court and either party may seek emergency, provisional relief before the appointment of an arbitrator as specified in section 17.14, below."
"This means that, except for qualifying small claims actions and emergency situations covered by section 17.14 below, you and riot games each waive the right to bring such claims to court, including the right to a jury trial."
17.8.
Can i bring a class or collective action claim?
(no.
"Sorry for more lawyer-shouting, but this is very important."
)
Y
Ou and riot games agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding.
"Unless both you and riot games agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person s or party s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding."
"Also, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party s individual claim(s)."
17.9.
What issues will the arbitrator decide?
(pretty much everything.
)
The arbitrator shall decide all issues in dispute between you and riot games.
17.10.
Who will administer the arbitration?
"(jams, using its comprehensive arbitration rules"
)
The arbitration shall be administered by jams pursuant to its comprehensive arbitration rules and procedures ( jams rules ).
A sole arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to these rules.
Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
17.11.
How does arbitration get started?
(one of us sends the other one and jams a written notification describing the situation and relief sought.
)
Either party may commence an arbitration proceeding.
The party commencing the arbitration is called the claimant
A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written demand for arbitration to jams and give notice to the other party.
Jams provides a form demand for arbitration on its website.
17.12.
Who s gonna pay for the arbitration?
"(we pay filing fees for lesser claims, but you have to pay filing fees for larger claims."
We won t seek attorney fees for arbitration from you unless your claim is found to be frivolous.
)
"Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the jams rules."
"We ll pay for all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and expenses if your dispute is for less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator finds your dispute frivolous."
If we prevail in arbitration we ll pay all of our attorneys fees and costs and won t seek to recover them from you.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.
17.13.
Where and how will the arbitration take place?
"(over the phone, in writing, or in your hometown your choice."
)
"You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, in person in the county where you live, or at another mutually agreed location."
17.14.
What about intellectual property infringement?
(either party may go to court for the limited purpose of seeking a provisional remedy.
)
"Either party may seek emergency provisional remedies, including injunctive or similar relief, pursuant to the jams rules or from a court of competent jurisdiction located in los angeles county, california, where necessary to protect that party s rights and interests for the infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights pending the appointment of an arbitrator."
17.15.
Can either of us tell our friends and twitter followers about the arbitration?
(nope.
)
"You and riot games agree that any dispute, claim or controversy that has been submitted to arbitration, and all related proceedings including any settlement agreement, shall be kept confidential."
"However, the prevailing party in any arbitration may file the arbitration award with any court of competent jurisdiction in order to have that award confirmed in a court order or judgment."
17.16.
What if part of this agreement to arbitrate isn t enforceable?
(the rest stays we keep as much of it as can be enforced under the law.
)
"You and riot games agree that if any part of this arbitration agreement is declared unenforceable, that part shall be severed and the remainder of this arbitration agreement shall be given full force and effect."
"However, if section 17.8, above (entitled, can i bring a class action claim? ), or any part of it is found to be unenforceable, then this entire arbitration agreement (i.e., all of part a of section 17) shall be severed from these terms and all claims between you and riot games shall be exclusively decided by a court located in los angeles county, california as set out in the relevant part of section 16 above."
