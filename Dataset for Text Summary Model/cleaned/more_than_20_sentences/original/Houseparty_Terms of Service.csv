Sharing on houseparty
Houseparty is designed to let you join video chats with not only your connections but also the connections of others.
If someone who is not your direct connection joins your video chat session you will get a notice.
Your public profile is available to both your connections and their connections.
"Other users may also be able to view your name, username, and top connections (i.e., who you speak to most often)."
"Connections can see when you were online last and a list of some of your other connections, and receive a notice when you go online and are in the house"

What can we say?
We can t do it alone.
Sometimes we have to work with other companies to help us deliver a great houseparty experience.
"We are owned by epic games, this means that we might rely on them to help us out."
We will share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves
"For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena or if a u.s."
Or non-u.s.
"Law enforcement agency, government agency, or investigatory body requests it."
"We may also share information we collect when we investigate potential fraud, abuse, or other similar violations of houseparty rules and codes of conduct."
We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business
"If all or part of our business is sold, we re part of a merger or acquisition, or there is a financing or bankruptcy, we may share information as part of that transaction."
We may also share information for other reasons we may describe to you or as permitted under law.
Your choices you have certain choices about how we use your information.
Those are described here:
You can opt out of certain marketing
To stop receiving our promotional emails or communications follow the instructions in any promotional message you get from us.
"If you opt out of getting marketing messages, you will continue to receive non-marketing messages from us about your relationship with us where permitted by law."
You can control certain aspects of your interactions with others on houseparty
Houseparty is meant to offer a fun way for people to interact with other people in ways similar to how you might in-person.
"Any connection of a participant in a video chat session may join an unlocked chat session, with or without an invite from you and whether or not you know him or her."
"However, your settings do give you certain controls over your video conversations, chats, and facemails."
We believe in respecting social norms.
"If one of your friends friends is about to join your houseparty chat, you ll receive a notice that they are joining."
"If you don t want friends of friends joining your party, you can lock the conversation."
"Anyone in the room can unlock the group session to allow more people to join, just like at a real house party."
You can learn more about this in our party guidelines in the app.
You can also choose private mode to have your rooms always locked by default.
You can control certain notifications about being online
"If you don t want your friends to know that you ve launched the app, then you can sneak into the house"
This is a one-time selection.
You can also select online notification preferences for yourself and friends in your notification settings.
"When you launch the app, you re starting a party and others may be able to immediately join you unless you lock the room."
You can control cookies and tracking tools
Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies or other tracking tools.
How you do so depends on the type of tool.
Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies.
"To control flash cookies, which we may use on certain websites from time to time, you can go here."
Why?
Because flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings.
"Our do not track policy: you may change your browser settings or take other steps to block, manage, or delete cookies."
"Not all of our websites and online services currently respond to browser do not track signals, so you will need to use your browser settings to effectively manage cookies."
"In some cases, blocking or disabling cookies may cause houseparty not to work as intended and some features may not be available."
You can control certain settings on your mobile device
"For example, you can turn off the location services or push notifications on your phone."
"To modify the push notifications you get from us, you can change your preferences in houseparty settings."
"You also can modify app level permissions, such as location collection, through your device settings."
