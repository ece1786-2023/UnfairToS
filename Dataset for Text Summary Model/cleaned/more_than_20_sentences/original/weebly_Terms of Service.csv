For the domain
"Name registration services (the domain services ) provided to you by weebly,"
The following terms and conditions also apply (the domain terms ).
Your use of
The domain services provided by weebly serves as your consent to these terms.
Some of the service packages include weebly registering an internet domain name
Or renewing your existing domain name (the domain name ) on your behalf.
For
"The purpose of procuring and/or maintaining domains, weebly will act only as"
The agent between you and the domain name service provider responsible for
"Domain name allocation (the registrar ), which will be register.com."
All new
Registrations and subsequent renewals of those registrations will therefore
Also be subject to the register.com terms and conditions located at:
Http://www.register.com/policy/servicesagreement.rcmx.
Weebly reserves the
"Right to utilize another domain name service provider at any time, in which"
Case the terms and condition of such organization will apply complementarily to
These domain terms and such other domain name service provider shall be deemed
A registrar for purposes of these terms.
Weebly may
"Provide one (1) free domain name for up to one year, with a new purchase of an"
Annual or bi-annual subscription plan.
The domain will be included for the
"Lifetime of your weebly account, and the domain will be registered in your name"
"And is yours to keep, as long as you cover any applicable domain registration"
Fees following the first year.
The free domain name only applies to certain
Top-level domains (e.g.

Holder ( registrant ) and the administrative contact when registering the
Domain name.

Name does not violate the rights of any third party or contravene any applicable
"Law, rule or regulation."
We may defer activation of a domain name until payment
Of the agreed fees for the registration services has been received.
Weebly is
In no position to influence the allocation of the domain name by the registrar.
We can neither guarantee that the requested domain names will be allocated to
You and/or that allocated domain names are free of third-party rights nor
Guarantee their continued existence.
Any information we provide regarding the
Availability of a domain name is based on the data provided by third parties
And only refers to the time that information is requested.
The domain will not
"Be deemed as allocated before registration of the domain in the name of you,"
"The registrant, and its entry in the database of the registrar."
The initial
Registration term for purchased domains may vary and such registration will
Auto-renew for successive 12-month periods.
You will be charged for
Auto-renewal forty-five (45) calendar days before your domain expires (even if
That date differs from your weebly website subscription renewal date).
"You can,"
"Of course, opt out of auto-renewal by turning off the auto-renew option in your"
Settings at any time before the auto-renewal takes effect.
Each purchased
"Domain name is registered in your name and is yours to keep, as long as you pay"
The applicable fees.
"If you purchase a new domain, or renew an existing domain,"
And cancel your purchase within the first thirty (30) days by contacting

"Information changes, you must immediately inform us of this change by updating"
It online.
"Please note that if your billing information, including your current"
"Credit card information, is not current, we will not renew your domain services"
And they may subsequently expire.
Subject to
"These terms and those of the registrar, you may transfer all domain names"
Registered through us to another domain name service provider by following the
Online instructions provided by weebly.
"Should we, due to failure on the part"
"Of you, the account holder, or the new domain name service provider, be unable"
"To make the domain transfer to your new domain name service provider, we are"
Expressly entitled to have the cancelled domain name deleted by the relevant
"Domain name service provider after the cancellation date has lapsed, and we"
Will not be liable to you or any third party for such deletion.
We reserve the
Right to allow domain transfers only if you have settled all undisputed pending

Transfer your registration records.
