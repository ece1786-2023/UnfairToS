"By using a paid service, you agree to pay the specified fees."
"Depending on the paid service, there may be one-time fees, recurring fees, or revenue-based fees."
"For recurring fees, we ll bill or charge you in the automatically-renewing interval (such as monthly, annually, or biennially) you select, on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time by contacting the relevant support team."
For revenue-based fees such as fees for the payments feature you pay us a percentage of the revenue your website generates.
Revenue-based fees are ongoing.

Payment
"If your payment fails, paid services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time (for example, if you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for paid services), or we suspect a payment is fraudulent, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to paid services without notice to you."
Automatic renewal
"To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring paid services are automatically renewed."
"This means that unless you cancel a paid service before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to use any payment mechanism we have on record for you, like credit cards or paypal, or invoice you (in which case payment is due within 15 days) to collect the then-applicable subscription fee as well as any taxes."
"By default, your paid services will be renewed for the same interval as your original subscription period, so for example, if you purchase a one-year subscription to a wordpress.com plan, you ll be charged each year for access for another 12-month period."
We may charge your account up to one month before the end of the subscription period to make sure pesky billing issues don t inadvertently disrupt your access to our services.
The date for the automatic renewal is based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed.
"If you ve purchased access to multiple services, you may have multiple renewal dates."

"If you have multiple paid services to cancel, repeat this process for each subscription."
Fees and changes
We may change our fees at any time in accordance with these terms and requirements under applicable law.
"This means that we may change our fees going forward, start charging fees for services that were previously free, or remove or update features or functionality that were previously included in the fees."
"If you don t agree with the changes, you must cancel your paid service."
No-show policy
"We may have a no-show policy for some paid services that require your participation (for example, our quick start sessions)."
