Description of the services
The services include access to the 23andme public website and personal
"Genotyping services, including the collection and analysis of your saliva sample."
You acknowledge and agree that the services are provided using the current
State of the art genetic research and technology available at the time of
Providing the services.
"As research progresses and scientific knowledge and technology evolve, 23andme"
Is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for
Its users.
You therefore acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of
The services which 23andme provides may change from time to time.
"As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that 23andme"
May stop (permanently or temporarily) providing some services (or any features
Within the services) to you or to users generally at 23andme's sole discretion.
You may stop using the services at any time.
You do not need to specifically
Inform 23andme when you stop using the services unless you are requesting
Closure of your account.
23andme assumes no responsibility for the use of services outside the terms
Of this tos or other applicable terms.
"In order to use the services, you must obtain internet access, either directly"
"Or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees"
Associated with such access.
You are solely responsible for paying such fees.
"You must provide all equipment necessary to make such internet connection,"
Including a computer and modem or other access device.
You are solely responsible
For providing such equipment.
You acknowledge and agree that while 23andme
May not currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions
You may send or receive through the services or on the amount of storage
"Space used for the provision of any service, such fixed upper limits may be"
"Set by 23andme at any time, at 23andme's discretion."
Important issues regarding 23andme services
"Once you obtain your genetic information, the knowledge is permanent."
You should not assume that any information we may be able to provide
"To you, whether now or as genetic research advances, will be welcome or positive."
"You should also understand that as research advances, in order for you to"
"Assess the meaning of your dna in the context of such advances, you may need"
To obtain further services from 23andme or from your physician or other health
Care provider.
You may learn information about yourself that you do not anticipate.
This information may evoke strong emotions and has the potential to
Alter your life and worldview.
You may discover things about yourself that
"Trouble you and that you may not have the ability to control or change (e.g.,"
"Your father is not genetically your father, surprising facts related to your"
"Ancestry, or that someone with your genotype may have a higher than average"
Chance of developing a specific condition or disease).
These outcomes could
"Have social, legal or economic implications."
"The laboratory may not be able to process your sample, and the"
Laboratory process may result in errors
The laboratory may not be
Able to process your sample if your saliva does not contain a sufficient volume
"Of dna, you do not provide enough saliva, or the results from processing do"
Not meet our standards for accuracy.
If the initial processing fails for any
"Of these reasons, 23andme will reprocess the same sample at no charge to you"
"If the second attempt to process the same sample fails, 23andme will offer to"
Send another kit to you to collect a second sample at no charge.
If you send another sample and 23andme's attempts to process the
"Second sample are unsuccessful, 23andme will not send additional sample"
Collection kits and you or the person who paid for the service (if that is
Not you) will be entitled to a complete refund of the amount paid to 23andme.
"In this event, you will not resubmit another sample through a future purchase"
Of the service.
If you breach these tos and resubmit another sample through
"A future purchase of the service and processing is not successful, 23andme"
Will not offer to reprocess the sample or provide you or the person who paid
For the service (if that is not you) a refund.
"Even for processing that meets our high standards, a small, unknown fraction"
Of the data generated during the laboratory process may be un-interpretable
"Or incorrect (referred to as ""errors"")"
"As this possibility is known in advance,"
Users are not entitled to refunds or entitled to make any other claims where
These errors occur.
The above sets out our sole responsibility to you in the event that we are
Unable to process your sample.
You should not change your health behaviors solely on the basis of
Information from 23andme
Make sure to discuss your genetic
Information with a physician or other health care provider before you act
Upon the genetic information resulting from 23andme services.
For most common
"Diseases, the genes we know about are only responsible for a small fraction"
Of the risk.
"There may be unknown genes, environmental factors, or lifestyle"
Choices that are far more important predictors.
If your data indicates that you are not at elevated genetic risk for a
"Particular disease or condition, you should not feel that you are protected."
The opposite is also true.
If your data indicates you are at an elevated genetic
"Risk for a particular disease or condition, it does not mean you will definitively"
Develop the disease or condition.
"In either case, if you have concerns or"
"Questions about what you learn through 23andme, you should contact your"
Physician or other health care provider.
Genetic research is not comprehensive
While we measure many
"Hundreds of thousands of data points from your dna, only a small percentage"
Of them are known to be related to human traits or health conditions.
The
"Research community is rapidly learning more about genetics, and an important"
Mission of 23andme is to conduct and contribute to this research.
Please note that many ethnic groups are not included in genetic studies.
Because interpretations provided in the services rely on these published
"Studies, some interpretations may not apply to you."
Please further note that future scientific research may change the interpretation
Of your dna and the scientific community may show previous research to be
Incomplete or inaccurate.
Genetic information you share with others could be used against your
Interests
You should be careful about sharing your genetic
Information with others.
"Currently, very few businesses or insurance companies"
"Request genetic information, but this could change in the future."
You may want to consult a lawyer to understand the extent of legal protection
Of your genetic information before you share it with anybody.
"Furthermore, genetic information that you choose to share with your physician"
Or other health care provider may become part of your medical record and
Through that route be accessible to other health care providers and/or
Insurance companies in the future.
"You acknowledge that genetic information that you share with family, friends"
Or employers may be used against your interests.
Even if you share genetic
"Information that has no or limited meaning today, that information could have"
Greater meaning in the future as technology improves and new discoveries are made.
"You should be aware that, if you are asked by an insurance company whether"
You have learned genetic information about health conditions and you do not
"Disclose this to them, this may be considered to be fraud or a breach of the"
Policy that you subsequently purchase.
"23andme services are for research, informational, and educational"
Use only
We do not provide medical advice.
"The genetic information provided by 23andme is for research,"
"Informational, and educational use only"
This means two things.
"First, many of the genetic discoveries that we report have not been clinically"
"Validated, and the technology we use, which is the same technology used by the"
"Research community, to date has not been widely used for clinical testing."
"Second, in order to expand and accelerate the understanding and practical"
"Application of genetic knowledge in health care, we invite all genotyped users"
To participate in 23andwe research.
Participation in such research is voluntary
And based upon an irb-approved consent document.
"As a result of the current state of genetic knowledge and understanding, our"
"Services are for research, informational, and educational purposes only."
The
Services are not intended to be used by you for any diagnostic purpose and are
Not a substitute for professional medical advice.
You should always seek the
Advice of your physician or other health care provider with any questions you
"May have regarding diagnosis, cure, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of"
Any disease or other medical condition or impairment or the status of your health.
"23andme does not endorse, promise or guarantee the effectiveness of any"
"Specific course of action, resources, tests, physician or other health care"
"Providers, drugs, biologics, medical devices or other products, procedures,"
Opinions or other information that may be mentioned on our website or available
Through our service.
"If we provide to you through our service any information that identify for you,"
Based on your genetic and self-reported information and scientific literature
"Or research, concerns about your health, this information is intended for"
Informational purposes only and for discussion with your physician or other
Healthcare provider.
We believe that:
Genetics is only part of the picture of any individual's state of being.
The state of the understanding of genetic information is rapidly
Evolving and at any given time we only comprehend part of the picture
Of the role of genetics.
And
Only a trained physician or other health care provider can assess
"Your current state of health or disease, taking into account many"
"Factors, including in some cases your genetics as well as your current"
"Symptoms, if any."
You should not take any decisions about your health or life based on the
"Information you receive through the service and, if you do, you do so entirely"
At your own risk.
We are licensed in california as a clinical laboratory and do not require a
"License to provide our services in the united kingdom, ireland, denmark,"
"Finland, the netherlands, and sweden."
