Here are the headlines (imagine them with a clock bonging in the background if you like):
You have to be 16 to use our tools.
"Your content is yours you own it, and you are responsible for it."
We ll only do what s needed for our services to work properly...
"...unless you are doing something illegal, in which case we can block and/or delete your stuff, and suspend your accounts."
"We may make changes to our terms, service and/or fees from time to time."
"If you have an account and don t like something we change, you can always cancel at any time."
