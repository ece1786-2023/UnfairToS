Agreement to arbitrate
"Please, please, please reach out to our customer support team (they re amazing!)"
Before bringing a legal case.
"If our customer support team can t help you with a dispute, then we both agree to go to binding arbitration, again, in san francisco, california."
Arbitration means a professional arbitrator will decide how to resolve our dispute instead of a judge or a jury deciding the case.
"Despite what we said above, there are some disputes that won t go to arbitration, but to court, like ip disputes and disputes about your violation of our acceptable use policy."
We also don t have to arbitrate small claims court cases.
"If we arbitrate, then we ll do it through the american arbitration association (aaa)."
"Before we even arbitrate, though, we ll try mediation with an aaa mediator."
"If mediation doesn t work, then we ll go to arbitration through aaa with only one arbitrator (one is so much easier)."
"And remember, the arbitrator s decision will be final and binding."
Agreement to arbitrate
"Before bringing a formal legal case, please first try contacting our customer support."
Most disputes can be resolved that way.
18.1
We both agree to arbitrate.
"If a dispute cannot be resolved through our customer support team, you or any of your affiliates on one hand and twilio and any of twilio s affiliates on the other hand, all agree to resolve any dispute relating to these terms or in relation to the services by binding arbitration in san francisco, california."
"This applies to all claims under any legal theory, unless the claim fits in one of the exceptions below in section 18.2 (exceptions to agreement to arbitrate)."
It also applies even after you have stopped using your customer account(s) or closed it.
"If we have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or applies to our dispute, we all agree that the arbitrator will decide that, too."
"Pursuant to this section 18 (agreement to arbitrate), you understand that you and your affiliates and twilio and its affiliates are giving up the right to have a judge and/or jury resolve any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these terms or the services."
18.2 exceptions to agreement to arbitrate.
"You and your affiliates on one hand, and twilio and its affiliates on the other hand, agree that we will go to court to resolve disputes relating to:"
"Your, your affiliates , twilio s or twilio s affiliates intellectual property (e.g., trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights or patents)."
Or
Your violation of our acceptable use policy .
"Also, any of us can bring a claim in small claims court either in san francisco, california, or the county where you live, or some other place we both agree on, if it qualifies to be brought in that court."
"In addition, if any of us brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated or any of us refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated, the other of us can ask a court to force us to go to arbitration to resolve the claim (i.e., compel arbitration)."
Any of us may also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.
18.3 details of arbitration procedure.
"Prior to filing any arbitration, both parties jointly agree to seek to resolve any dispute between us by mediation conducted by the american arbitration association (aaa), with all mediator fees and expenses paid equally by the parties."
"If mediation is not successful, either party may initiate an arbitration proceeding with aaa."
You can look at aaa s rules and procedures on their website http://www.adr.org or you can call them at 1-800-778-7879.
"The arbitration will be governed by the then-current version of aaa s commercial arbitration rules (the ""rules"") and will be held with a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the rules."
"To the extent anything described in this section 18 conflicts with the rules, the language of this section 18 applies."
Each of us will be entitled to get a copy of non-privileged relevant documents in the possession or control of the other party and to take a reasonable number of depositions.
All such discovery will be in accordance with procedures approved by the arbitrator.
This section 18 does not alter in any way the statute of limitations that would apply to any claims or counterclaims asserted by either party.
"The arbitrator s award will be based on the evidence admitted and the substantive law of the state of california and the united states, as applicable, and will contain an award for each issue and counterclaim."
The award will provide in writing the factual findings and legal reasoning for such award.
The arbitrator will not be entitled to modify these terms.
"Except as provided in the federal arbitration act, the arbitration award will be final and binding on the parties."
Judgment may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
We both agree not to bring a class action suit against the other.
"If for some reason a court decides that this term isn t enforceable, then this entire section 18 will go away."
18.4
Class action waiver.
"Both you and your affiliates, on one hand, and twilio and its affiliates on the other hand, agree that any claims or controversies between us must be brought against each other on an individual basis only."
"That means neither you and your affiliates on one hand nor twilio and its affiliates on the other hand can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action."
"The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person s or entity s claims into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative proceeding (unless we agree otherwise)."
"And, the arbitrator s decision or award in one person s or entity s case can only impact the person or entity that brought the claim, not other twilio customers, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other customers."
"If a court decides that this section 18.4 (class action waiver) is not enforceable or valid, then the entire section 18 (agreement to arbitrate) will be null and void (i.e., go away)."
"But, the rest of the terms will still apply"
