The service the vpn service protects personal information with the use of encryption and masks user metadata by hiding the user's ip address and replacing it with one of ours.
"This replacement address is shared with many other users, which not only protects each individual's user data but also hides his or her pattern of activity."
"Therefore, the traceable chain between users and their online activity is broken."
