Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.,0

Arbitrator,0
"Any arbitration between you and doist will be settled under the federal arbitration act and administered by the american arbitration association ( aaa ) under its consumer arbitration rules (collectively, aaa rules ) as modified by these terms.",0

"Doist s address for notice is: doist inc., 2100 geng road, suite 210, palo alto, ca 94303.",0
The notice of arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.,0
And (b) set forth the specific relief sought ( demand ).,0
"The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the notice of arbitration is received, you or doist may commence an arbitration proceeding.",0
All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.,0
"During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or doist must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.",0
"If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by doist in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, doist will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator.",0
"Or (ii) $10,000.",0
Fees,0
"If you commence arbitration in accordance with these terms, doist will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the aaa rules.",0
"Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in santa clara county, california, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.",0
(b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing.,0
Or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the aaa rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.,0
"If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in federal rule of civil procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the aaa rules.",0
"In that case, you agree to reimburse doist for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the aaa rules.",0
"Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.",0
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator s ruling on the merits.,0
No class actions,1
You and doist agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.,1
