Arbitration: read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from genius.,0
"For any dispute with genius, you agree to first contact us at terms@genius.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.",0
"In the unlikely event that genius has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, ""claims""), by binding arbitration by jams, inc.",0
"(""jams""), under the optional expedited arbitration procedures then in effect for jams, except as provided herein.",0
Jams may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com.,0
"The arbitration will be conducted in new york, new york, unless you and genius agree otherwise.",0
"If you are using the service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any jams filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with jams rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.",0
"If you are using the service for non-commercial purposes: (i) jams may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from jams.",0
"(ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney's fees and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.",0
"And (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process.",0
Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.,0
Nothing in this section shall be deemed as preventing genius from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of genius's proprietary interests.,0
"Class action/jury trial waiver: with respect to all persons and entities, regardless of whether they have obtained or used the service for personal, commercial or other purposes, all claims must be brought in the parties' individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action or other representative proceeding.",0
"This waiver applies to class arbitration, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims.",0
"You agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and genius are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding of any kind.",0
Termination,0
"In addition to the termination rights set forth elsewhere herein, you agree that genius, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the service and remove and discard any content (including without limitation your user content) within the service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if genius believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these terms.",0

Assignment,0
"These terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by genius without restriction.",0
Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.,0
General,0
"These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and genius and govern your use of the service, superseding any prior agreements between you and genius with respect to the service.",0
"You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use certain features of the service, affiliate or third-party services, third-party content or third-party software.",0
The failure of genius to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.,0
