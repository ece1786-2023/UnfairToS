"Dispute means any dispute, claim, or controversy (except those specifically exempted below) between you and epic that relates to your use or attempted use of epic s products or services and epic s products and services generally, including without limitation the validity, enforceability, or scope of this binding individual arbitration section.",0
"You and epic agree to arbitrate all disputes regardless of whether the dispute is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory.",0

Epic will send our copy to your registered email address and any billing address you have provided us.,0
The arbitration will be conducted by a single jams arbitrator selected with substantial experience in resolving intellectual-property and commercial-contract disputes.,0
You and epic both agree that the arbitration will be conducted in the english language and that the arbitrator will be bound by these terms.,0
"If an in-person hearing is required, the hearing will take place either in wake county, north carolina, or where you reside.",0
You choose.,0
The arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve the dispute.,0
"Unless you and epic agree otherwise, any decision or award will include a written statement stating the decision of each claim and the basis for the award, including the arbitrator s essential factual and legal findings and conclusions",0
The arbitrator may only award legal or equitable remedies that are requested by you or epic to satisfy one of our individual claims (that the arbitrator determines are supported by credible relevant evidence),0
The arbitrator may not award relief against epic respecting any person other than you.,0

3.3 arbitration fees and location:,0
"If you start the arbitration, you must pay the jams filing fee required for consumer arbitrations.",0
"In some situations, epic will help with your fees to (hopefully) get us to a resolution quickly and fairly:",0
"If the dispute involves $10,000 or less, epic will pay all of the jams costs, including the fees you otherwise would have been required to pay.",0
"If the above doesn t apply to you, but you demonstrate that arbitration costs will be prohibitive compared to litigation costs, epic will pay as much of your jams costs as the arbitrator finds is necessary to prevent arbitration from being cost-prohibitive (as compared to the cost of litigation)",0
"Even if epic wins the arbitration and the applicable law or the jams rules allow epic to seek our portion of the jams fees from you, we won t.",0
The fee assistance offered above is contingent upon you bringing the arbitration claim in good faith .,0
"If the arbitrator finds you brought an arbitration claim against epic for an improper purpose, frivolously, or without a sufficient pre-claim investigation into the facts or applicable law, then the payment of all fees will be governed by the jams rules",0
Jams costs do not include your attorneys fees and costs and attorneys fees and jams costs are not counted when determining how much a dispute involves.,0
"Epic won t seek our attorneys fees or expenses from you in any arbitration, even if the law or the jams rules entitle us to do so.",0
"If you choose to be represented by an attorney, you will pay your own attorneys fees and costs unless the applicable law provides otherwise",0
3.4 notice and filing:,0
"If a dispute must be arbitrated, you or epic must start arbitration of the dispute within two (2) years from when the dispute first arose",0
