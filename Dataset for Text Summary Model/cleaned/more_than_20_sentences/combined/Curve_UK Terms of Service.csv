Card currency in the curve app to a different currency than that of the payment card itself then your payment card issuer may charge a fee for using their currency conversion services.,0

We can let you know the rate for a transaction if you get in touch with us.,0
Weekend exchange rate.,0
"This is the rate at the time the markets are closed in london, u.k.",0
