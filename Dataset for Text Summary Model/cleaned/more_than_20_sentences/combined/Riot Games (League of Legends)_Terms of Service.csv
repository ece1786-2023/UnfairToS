Part a: general dispute resolution (no matter where you live),0

"If we have a dispute, can we 1 v 1 instead?",0

Disputes can be expensive and time consuming for both parties (justice doesn t come on swift wings outside valoran).,0

(a private dispute resolution method.,0

Arbitration is an alternative dispute resolution process in which the parties agree to have their disputes decided by a neutral third party and not by a sitting judge or jury.,0
Arbitration allows parties to resolve their disputes privately and without the formality of going to court.,0
"Arbitration follows different procedural rules than a court would, and is subject to very limited review by courts.",0
17.6.,0

(yes.,0
),0
The arbitrator shall have the power to award any type of legal or equitable relief that would be available in a court of competent jurisdiction.,0

"Unless both you and riot games agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person s or party s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding.",1
"Also, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party s individual claim(s).",1

),0
"Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the jams rules.",0
"We ll pay for all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and expenses if your dispute is for less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator finds your dispute frivolous.",0
If we prevail in arbitration we ll pay all of our attorneys fees and costs and won t seek to recover them from you.,0
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.,0
17.13.,0

),0

"However, if section 17.8, above (entitled, can i bring a class action claim? ), or any part of it is found to be unenforceable, then this entire arbitration agreement (i.e., all of part a of section 17) shall be severed from these terms and all claims between you and riot games shall be exclusively decided by a court located in los angeles county, california as set out in the relevant part of section 16 above.",0
