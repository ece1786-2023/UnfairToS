Important issues regarding 23andme services,0

"To you, whether now or as genetic research advances, will be welcome or positive.",1
"You should also understand that as research advances, in order for you to",0
"Assess the meaning of your dna in the context of such advances, you may need",0
To obtain further services from 23andme or from your physician or other health,0
Care provider.,0
You may learn information about yourself that you do not anticipate.,0
This information may evoke strong emotions and has the potential to,0
Alter your life and worldview.,0
You may discover things about yourself that,0
"Trouble you and that you may not have the ability to control or change (e.g.,",0
"Your father is not genetically your father, surprising facts related to your",0
"Ancestry, or that someone with your genotype may have a higher than average",0
Chance of developing a specific condition or disease).,0
These outcomes could,0
"Have social, legal or economic implications.",0
"The laboratory may not be able to process your sample, and the",0
Laboratory process may result in errors,0
The laboratory may not be,0
Able to process your sample if your saliva does not contain a sufficient volume,0
"Of dna, you do not provide enough saliva, or the results from processing do",0
Not meet our standards for accuracy.,0
If the initial processing fails for any,0

"A future purchase of the service and processing is not successful, 23andme",0
Will not offer to reprocess the sample or provide you or the person who paid,0
For the service (if that is not you) a refund.,0
"Even for processing that meets our high standards, a small, unknown fraction",0
Of the data generated during the laboratory process may be un-interpretable,0
"Or incorrect (referred to as ""errors"")",0
"As this possibility is known in advance,",0
Users are not entitled to refunds or entitled to make any other claims where,0
These errors occur.,0
The above sets out our sole responsibility to you in the event that we are,0
Unable to process your sample.,0
You should not change your health behaviors solely on the basis of,0
Information from 23andme,0
Make sure to discuss your genetic,0
Information with a physician or other health care provider before you act,0
Upon the genetic information resulting from 23andme services.,0
For most common,0
"Diseases, the genes we know about are only responsible for a small fraction",0
Of the risk.,0
"There may be unknown genes, environmental factors, or lifestyle",0
Choices that are far more important predictors.,0
If your data indicates that you are not at elevated genetic risk for a,0
"Particular disease or condition, you should not feel that you are protected.",0
The opposite is also true.,0
If your data indicates you are at an elevated genetic,0
"Risk for a particular disease or condition, it does not mean you will definitively",0
Develop the disease or condition.,0
"In either case, if you have concerns or",0
"Questions about what you learn through 23andme, you should contact your",0
Physician or other health care provider.,0
Genetic research is not comprehensive,0
While we measure many,0
"Hundreds of thousands of data points from your dna, only a small percentage",0
Of them are known to be related to human traits or health conditions.,0
The,0
"Research community is rapidly learning more about genetics, and an important",0
Mission of 23andme is to conduct and contribute to this research.,0
Please note that many ethnic groups are not included in genetic studies.,0
Because interpretations provided in the services rely on these published,0
"Studies, some interpretations may not apply to you.",0
Please further note that future scientific research may change the interpretation,0
Of your dna and the scientific community may show previous research to be,0
Incomplete or inaccurate.,0
Genetic information you share with others could be used against your,0
Interests,0
You should be careful about sharing your genetic,0
Information with others.,0
"Currently, very few businesses or insurance companies",0
"Request genetic information, but this could change in the future.",0
You may want to consult a lawyer to understand the extent of legal protection,0
Of your genetic information before you share it with anybody.,0
"Furthermore, genetic information that you choose to share with your physician",0
Or other health care provider may become part of your medical record and,0
Through that route be accessible to other health care providers and/or,0
Insurance companies in the future.,0
"You acknowledge that genetic information that you share with family, friends",0
Or employers may be used against your interests.,0
Even if you share genetic,0
"Information that has no or limited meaning today, that information could have",0
Greater meaning in the future as technology improves and new discoveries are made.,0
"You should be aware that, if you are asked by an insurance company whether",0
You have learned genetic information about health conditions and you do not,0
"Disclose this to them, this may be considered to be fraud or a breach of the",0
Policy that you subsequently purchase.,0
"23andme services are for research, informational, and educational",0
Use only,0
We do not provide medical advice.,0
"The genetic information provided by 23andme is for research,",0
"Informational, and educational use only",0
This means two things.,0
"First, many of the genetic discoveries that we report have not been clinically",0
"Validated, and the technology we use, which is the same technology used by the",0
"Research community, to date has not been widely used for clinical testing.",0
"Second, in order to expand and accelerate the understanding and practical",0
"Application of genetic knowledge in health care, we invite all genotyped users",0
To participate in 23andwe research.,0
Participation in such research is voluntary,0
And based upon an irb-approved consent document.,0
"As a result of the current state of genetic knowledge and understanding, our",0
"Services are for research, informational, and educational purposes only.",0

Based on your genetic and self-reported information and scientific literature,0
"Or research, concerns about your health, this information is intended for",0
Informational purposes only and for discussion with your physician or other,0
Healthcare provider.,0
We believe that:,0
Genetics is only part of the picture of any individual's state of being.,0
The state of the understanding of genetic information is rapidly,0
Evolving and at any given time we only comprehend part of the picture,0
Of the role of genetics.,0
And,0
Only a trained physician or other health care provider can assess,0
"Your current state of health or disease, taking into account many",0
"Factors, including in some cases your genetics as well as your current",0
"Symptoms, if any.",0
You should not take any decisions about your health or life based on the,0
"Information you receive through the service and, if you do, you do so entirely",0
At your own risk.,0
