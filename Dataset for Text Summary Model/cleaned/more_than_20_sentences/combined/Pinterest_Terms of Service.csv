Arbitration is a more informal way to resolve our disagreements than a lawsuit in court.,0

"If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the aaa rules.",0
"If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the aaa rules.",0
"Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.",0
"Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts, including for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the service.",0
"All claims must be brought in the parties' individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims.",0
"You agree that,",0
"By entering into these terms, you and pinterest are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.",1
Nothing in these terms of service shall affect any non-waivable statutory rights that apply to you.,0
"To the extent any claim, dispute or controversy regarding pinterest or our service isn t arbitrable under applicable laws or otherwise: you and pinterest both agree that any claim or dispute regarding pinterest will be resolved exclusively in accordance with section 12 of these terms.",0

More simply put,1
The bay area is beautiful this time of year.,0
"It doesn't matter what time of year it is, that's what's so great!",0
"Anyway, you'll have to sue us here",0
"In the eea, this applies if you're a merchant, but not if you're a consumer.",0
